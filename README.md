An interactive _challenge tracking application_ built with _React (Vite)_.  
This app allows you to _create challenges, set a **completion deadline, and later mark them as **completed_ or _failed_ when the time is up.

I originally built it while following Maximilian Schwarzmüller's React Course (Animation section with Framer Motion), but I took it further by:

- Making it _fully responsive_
- Replacing _Context API with Redux Toolkit_
- Adding extra _custom animations with Framer Motion_
- Persisting data with _Local Storage_
- Bootstrapped with _Vite_ for a faster dev experience 🚀

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Add a new challenge with a title & deadline.
- ⏰ Countdown timer until challenge deadline.
- ✅ Mark challenges as _completed_.
- ❌ Mark challenges as _failed_ if not completed on time.
- 💾 Data persistence with _Local Storage_.
- 🎨 Smooth animations with _Framer Motion_.
- 📱 Fully _responsive design_.
- 🔄 State management powered by _Redux Toolkit_.
